# Netlify Configuration for Backend API
# Note: Netlify is primarily for frontend/static sites and serverless functions
# For full backend APIs with databases, Railway is recommended

[build]
  # Point to backend directory (though Netlify won't build Node.js backends the same way)
  base = "backend"
  publish = "backend"

# Netlify Functions (if you want to use Netlify Functions instead)
# Uncomment if you want to convert to serverless functions
# [functions]
#   directory = "backend/netlify/functions"

# Redirects - proxy API requests to a backend server
# You'd need to set up a backend server URL in your Netlify environment

# Note: For a full Express backend like this, Railway or similar platforms are better suited
# This config is mainly to prevent the "frontend directory not found" error
